                    <h2> Family Psychology is a specialist therapeutic service&nbsp;for children, adolescents and adults.
Our practice is a safe place for families to explore complex issues. Our work is always based on evidence and best practice guidelines and we aim to help families come to a better understanding of themselves and each other.
Informed by attachment theory, we specialise in the areas of trauma, separations, anxiety, grief, child behaviour, adolescent issues, perinatal depression and parenting issues. We believe that small changes, new ideas or a change of perspective can sometimes be the difference that people need. </h2>

                <h4>Therapy for Children</h4>
                <p>Children sometimes need psychological help, just like adults do. Treatment typically begins when parents, teachers or school counsellors notice that children arenâ€™t functioning as well as they could. Our child counselling services are aimed at supporting children who have behavioural, emotional and social concerns. We aim to provide children with a safe place to explore their worries, develop understanding about themselves and come up with ideas to overcome challenges.</p>

                <h4>Therapy for Adolescents</h4>
                <p>Adolescence is both an exciting and challenging time. Young people may be negotiating many physical, hormonal and emotional changes as well as making his or her own significant choices for the first time. The developmental tasks of this stage of life involve both figuring out and finding a unique identity, while at the same time fitting in and standing out simultaneously. It can be a time when confidence can be undermined and some teenagers need extra support.</p>

                <h4>Family Therapy</h4>
                <p>We aim to involve family members in the therapeutic process where possible to ensure that the child is well supported within their family system. Our child and family counselling services incorporate proven cognitive based therapy, interpersonal therapy and family therapy and include practical strategies and solutions to meet family objectives.
